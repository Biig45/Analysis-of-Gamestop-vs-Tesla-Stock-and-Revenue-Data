# Analysis_Gamestop_v_Tesla_Stock_and_Revenue_Data

This project was a part of IBM's Coursera course (Python Project for Data Science).

In this Project, I've extracted financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data I've visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I've worked with are Tesla and GameStop.
